Git workflow

Git clone
git checkout branch name
make some changes
git add -> it will update to stage/index from working directory
git commit -> from stage to local repository
git push -> from local repository to feature branch
git merge -> feature branch to master branch


Rebase - is used to reapply commits on a different branch
reset - undo commits on the current branch
revert -

fetch vs pull

git fetch will fetch data from master to local repository and if we want in working directory then we have to call git merge

Git Pull = Git Fetch + Git Merge

Git Stash - stash current working directory and stage file and then you can switch to different directory
Git Stash apply - will apply to stash files and you start continue your work
Git Stash drop -- drop stack files 

git remote 

git hard reset vs git soft
reset a soft git reset does not revert staged or working tree files back to a previous state, while the hard git reset does.
