Basic of networking

DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that is used to translate human-readable domain names (such as www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.

ARP: ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is used to convert an IP address to its corresponding physical address(i.e., MAC Address). ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiverâ€™s machine. 

RARP: RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. As the name suggests, it provides the IP address of the device given a physical address as input. But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into the picture.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): A protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices on a network.

Types of Computer Networks
There are mainly five types of Computer Networks

	Personal Area Network (PAN)
	Local Area Network (LAN)
	Campus Area Network (CAN)
	Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	Wide Area Network (WAN)

Transmission Modes in Computer Networks
	Simplex : the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. 
	half duplex : In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
	full duplex : In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously

Transport     -----------> L4 Header | DATA | <------------ 
              source and destination ip address added in L3 Header
Network       ----------->| L3-H | L4-H |DATA| <-------------- 
               mac address added in L2 Header
DataLink      ----------->|L2-H|L3-H|L4-H|DATA| <---------------

physical      It takes frames from DataLink layer and encapsulate it aka bits


Services Offered by Network Layer
The services which are offered by the network layer protocol are as follows: 

	Packetizing
	Routing 
	Forwarding


Responsibilities of a Transport Layer
	The Process to Process Delivery
	End-to-End Connection between Hosts
	Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
	Congestion Control
	Data integrity and Error correction
	Flow control
	

What is C2 framework?
Command-and-control (C2) frameworks serve as a means to remotely manage and access compromised devices. They allow for the creation of various payload types, called implants, that are dropped on victim machines by attackers, enabling them to retain access and control over the infected victim.


In class A first bit is reserved out 32 bit so total 31 bit is remaining for address 

so 2**31 will be the no of address = 2147483648

no of networks that is 2**7 bit because initial 8 bit belong to network and rest 24 bits belong to host
so 2**7 = 128 

no of hosts that is 2**24 = 16777216 -2 because first address is reserved to identify network and last address is for broadcasting
